<p><strong>Presentation title:</strong>Managing complexity in the software we build to study complex systems</p>
<p><strong>Speaker bio:</strong> Allen Lee is a computer scientist and research software engineer working to (hopefully) improve our abilities to understand and sustainably evolve with the complex adaptive systems that we all collectively share. He helps lead open science initiatives like the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences and the Open Modeling Foundation and contributes to research in the commons and collective action, as well as computational literacy initiatives like the Carpentries.</p>

<h2>Bios</h2>
<p><strong>Christine Kirpatrick</strong> leads the San Diego Supercomputer Centerâ€™s (SDSC) Research Data Services division, which manages large-scale infrastructure, networking, and services for research projects of regional and national scope. Her research is in data-centric AI, working at the intersection of ML and FAIR, with a focus on making AI more efficient to save on power consumption and 'time to science'. Kirkpatrick serves as PI of the <a href="https://www.farr-rcn.org/">FAIR in ML, AI Readiness & Reproducibility RCN</a> which focuses on promoting better practices for AI, improving reproducibility, and exploring research gaps in data-centric AI. In addition, Kirkpatrick founded the <a href="https://www.gofair.us/">GO FAIR US</a> Office, is PI of the West Big Data Innovation <a href="https://www.westbigdatahub.org/">Hub</a>, is on the Executive Committee for the <a href="https://www.openstoragenetwork.org/">Open Storage Network</a>, and is Co-PI of the NSF-funded <a href="https://tgr.nmwrri.nmsu.edu/">Transboundary Groundwater Resiliency</a> (TGR) network. Christine serves as a member for The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on their Board on Research Data and Information (BRDI) to improve the stewardship, policy and use of digital data and information for science and the broader society. She serves as the Secretary General of the International Science Council's Committee on Data (CODATA), co-Chairs the FAIR Digital Object Forum, is on the Advisory Board for the Helmholtz Federated IT Services (HIFIS), and served on the National Academies of Sciencesâ€™ U.S. National Committee for the Committee on Data.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Brenner</strong> is a Director in the University of Notre Dame Center for Research Computing (NDCRC) and concurrent Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Additionally, Dr. Brenner serves in the US Air Force Reserves as a cyber officer and Senior Advisor to the CIO of Air Education and Training Command.  He is also a registered Professional Engineer and has held numerous leadership roles in commercial industry and tech startups.  At the NDCRC he leads both the research software development division and the HPC and user support divisions, managing millions of dollars in software engineering projects and cyberinfrastructure deployments annually.  He has been the principal investigator (PI) on numerous federally funded grants and is currently the PI on a US Navy funded research collaborative on Trusted AI. Dr. Brenner also serves as a faculty representative in the University of Notre Dameâ€™s role in the multinational AI Alliance and US AI Safety Institute Consortium.  He also continues an active research group publishing in the areas of advanced algorithms and architectures for accelerated discovery, trustworthy AI and cyberphysical systems security.</p>

<p><strong>Sandra Gesing</strong> is the Executive Director of the US Research Software Engineer Association and a Senior Researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Her research focuses on science gateways, computational workflows as well as distributed and parallel computing. She is especially interested in sustainability of research software, usability of computational methods and reproducibility of research results and she supports open science initiatives. Before her positions at US-RSE and SDSC, she was a senior research scientist, the Scientific Outreach and DEI Lead at the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI), University of Illinois System, Chicago. Prior to DPI, she was an associate research professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and a computational scientist in the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US. Before she moved to the US, she was a research associate at the University of Edinburgh, UK, at the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany, Additionally, she has perennial experience as a project manager and system developer in industry in the US and Germany. As head of a system programmer group, she has led long-term software projects. She received her Masterâ€™s degree in computer science from extramural studies at the FernUniversitÃ¤t Hagen and her PhD in computer science from the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany.</p>

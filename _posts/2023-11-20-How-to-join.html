<p><em>The ModelShare Program will develop guidelines for researchers to effectively implement ethical model-sharing practices throughout the modeling lifecycle. The guidelines will be developed through a series of workshops, and published in July 2024.</em></p>

<p>In early 2024, the Open Modeling Foundation will host a series of workshops to overcome a widespread challenge in the sphere of computational modeling: there are no common standards nor clear processes for sharing computational models at the point of publication. This lack of standards complicates the task of effectively planning and resourcing research projects that intend to promote open and ethical modeling efforts across domains.</p>

<p>Each of the two-hour workshops will cover one of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Guidance and standards:</b> Approaches and practices to describing and documenting models</li>
  <li><b>Development environments and platforms:</b> Model development in software development platforms and environments (e.g., GitHub </li>
  <li><b>Research computing:</b> Model development and testing, data analytics, and workflows</li>
  <li><b>Preservation and publication:</b> Model preservation in repositories and sharing in publications</li>
  <li><b>Publication and discoverability:</b> Model metadata and availability in academic databases and search indexes</li>
  <li><b>Sustainability: </b> Machine learning, computational models, and ethics</li>
  <li><b>Assessment:</b> Reflection on open science and FAIR indicators for models</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now seeking speakers to share their insights about one of these topics. To ensure audience members gain a greater breadth of knowledge, speakers may be paired for their workshops.</p>

<p>If you are interested in speaking at one of the workshops, read more details <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1YC9AOOwXF3QlBRUrqFFkcW_e6HThAP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

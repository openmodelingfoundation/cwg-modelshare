<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Volker Grimm, Open Modelling Foundation</p>
<p><strong>Presentation title:</strong> Developing standards for modeling is critical and exciting: lessons from ODD and TRACE</p>
<p><strong>Speaker bio:</strong> Volker is a biologist and physicist and works as a senior scientist at the Department of Ecological Modelling at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research â€“ UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, and as a professor for Theoretical Ecology at the University of Potsdam. He co-authored both the first monograph and the first textbook on agent-based modeling. His main research interest is in optimizing model development, communication, and validation. He has  also been involved in modeling a broad range of plant and animal populations and communities, and worked on the use of key concepts such as stability or resilience. He has co/supervised more than 30 PhD students.</p>

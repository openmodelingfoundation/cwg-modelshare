<p><strong>Panellists:</strong>  Lauren Cadwallader, PLOS; Lars Holm Nielsen, CERN IT</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong>  Michael Barton, Arizona State University, Open Modeling Foundation</p>

<h2>Bios</h2>
<p><strong>Lauren Cadwallader</strong> is the Open Research Manager at the <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS). In this role, she works to advance the adoption of open science practices - particularly data and code sharing - in the research communities that publish with PLOS. This includes working with communities to understand their needs, the challenges they face and any assets they may bring, and from there develop solutions that can increase the adoption of open science. <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">This work is shared</a> as openly as possible to encourage other publishers and communities to learn from PLOSâ€™ work and hopefully implement their own solutions.</p>
<p>>Prior to working at PLOS, Lauren worked in the Office of Scholarly Communications at Cambridge University Library in roles related to Open Access, Open Research training and Research Data Management. Before that, she worked as an archaeologist, gaining her PhD in 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Lars Holm Nielsen</strong> is Head of Open Science Repositories at CERN IT where he leads Open Science services and projects for large-scale scholarly repositories. He built and grew Zenodo.org over the past 10 years from a proof of concept to being the largest general-purpose research repository supporting researchers around the world in any discipline to share and preserve their research products. He further leads the 25 partners InvenioRDM open source repository platform, helping institutions and domains to provide Open Science services. He has pioneered innovative solutions across research domains for research software citations as well as unlocking FAIR biodiversity data. Heâ€™s work focuses on providing core enabling infrastructure for Open Science to help accelerate scientific discovery and ultimately improve how science is conducted.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Barton</strong> is a complex system scientist and Professor in the Schools of <a href="https://scas.asu.edu/">Complex Adaptive Systems</a> and <a href="https://shesc.asu.edu/">Human Evolution & Social Change</a> at Arizona State University (USA). He is Executive Director of the <a href="https://openmodelingfoundation.org">Open Modeling Foundation</a>, a global consortium of organizations to promote standards and best practices in computational modeling across the social and natural sciences. He also directs the <a href="https://comses.net">Network for Computational Modeling in Social and Ecological Sciences</a>, an international scientific network to enable accessibility, open science, and best practices for computation in the socio-ecological sciences. Barton received his BA from the University of Kansas in Anthropology/Archaeology, and MA and PhD from the University of Arizona in Anthropology/Archaeology and Geosciences. His research centers around  long-term human ecology, landscape dynamics, and the multi-dimensional interactions between social and biophysical systems, integrating computational modeling, geospatial technologies, and data science with geoarchaeological field studies. Barton has directed transdisciplinary research on hunter-gatherers and small-holder farmers in the Mediterranean and North America for over three decades, and directs research on human-environmental interactions in the modern world. He is a member of the open-source <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org">GRASS GIS</a> Development Team and Project Steering Committee, dedicated to making advanced geospatial technologies openly accessible to the world.</p>

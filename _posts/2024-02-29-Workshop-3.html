<p><strong>Moderator:</strong>  Michael Barton, Arizona State University, Open Modeling Foundation</p>

<h2>Bios</h2>
<p><strong>Lauren Cadwallader</strong> is the Open Research Manager at the <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS). In this role, she works to advance the adoption of open science practices - particularly data and code sharing - in the research communities that publish with PLOS. This includes working with communities to understand their needs, the challenges they face and any assets they may bring, and from there develop solutions that can increase the adoption of open science. <a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/">This work is shared</a> as openly as possible to encourage other publishers and communities to learn from PLOSâ€™ work and hopefully implement their own solutions.</p>
<p>Prior to working at PLOS, Lauren worked in the Office of Scholarly Communications at Cambridge University Library in roles related to Open Access, Open Research training and Research Data Management. Before that, she worked as an archaeologist, gaining her PhD in 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Lars Holm Nielsen</strong> is Head of Open Science Repositories at CERN IT where he leads Open Science services and projects for large-scale scholarly repositories. He built and grew Zenodo.org over the past 10 years from a proof of concept to being the largest general-purpose research repository supporting researchers around the world in any discipline to share and preserve their research products. He further leads the 25 partners InvenioRDM open source repository platform, helping institutions and domains to provide Open Science services. He has pioneered innovative solutions across research domains for research software citations as well as unlocking FAIR biodiversity data. Heâ€™s work focuses on providing core enabling infrastructure for Open Science to help accelerate scientific discovery and ultimately improve how science is conducted.</p>

<p><strong>Feilim Mac Gabhann</strong> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and a core faculty member of the Institute for Computational Medicine, at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>He earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering from University College Dublin in 1997, and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2006. Following a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Cardiovascular Research Center at the University of Virginia, he joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins in 2009.</p>
<p>His lab develops computational models of systems pharmacology â€“ in particular, building models with high levels of detail in mechanism of action, and applying them to simulate different therapies including small molecule drugs, biologics, gene therapy, and cell transplants. His lab applies this research to improve therapies in a multiple disease areas, including peripheral artery disease, cancer, HIV, and gynecological disorders. His research is supported by the multiple institutes of the National Institutes of Health, including NHLBI, NIGMS, and NIAID.</p>
<p>Feilim has served as an Editorial Board member for PLOS Computational Biology for eight years, as Associate Editor, Deputy Editor, and Deputy-Editor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Feilim currently serves as the director of Johns Hopkins' Doctoral Training Program in Biomedical Engineering, and previously served as the first director of Johns Hopkins' Office for Undergraduate Research. He has received the 2019 Career Champion award, the 2016 William H. Huggins Excellence in Teaching Award, and a 2015 Catalyst Award for research from his home institution. National awards include the American Physiological Society Arthur C. Guyton Award for Excellence in Integrative Physiology (2012), Sloan Research Fellowship (2012), the Microcirculatory Society August Krogh Young Investigator Award (2010), and the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (2008).</p>

<p><strong>Jason Papin</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. After his training in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego, Jason Papin joined the faculty at the University of Virginia in 2005.</p>
<p>His lab works on problems in systems biology, metabolic network analysis, infectious disease, toxicology, and cancer, developing computational approaches for integrating high-throughput data into predictive computational models. He manages a lab with both experimental and computational activities and his research group has had continuous support with funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation (including as a CAREER award recipient), Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and several private foundations and companies. Jason is an elected fellow of the Biomedical Engineering Society and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering.</p>
<p>Jason previously served as an Associate Editor, Deputy Editor, and Deputy-Editor-in-Chief of PLOS Computational Biology as well as on the editorial board of other journals in the field of computational biology. His service to the scientific community also includes effort as an elected member of the Board of Directors of the Biomedical Engineering Society, as a standing member of the Biodata Management and Analysis (BDMA) NIH study section, and numerous other review panels of federal funding agencies and academic programs.</p>
<p>His teaching and mentoring have been recognized with receipt of awards for undergraduate and graduate teaching. Jasonâ€™s work also involves translational activities with recognition as an inventor on several disclosures of intellectual property, in addition to consulting with multiple biotechnology companies.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Barton</strong> is a complex system scientist and Professor in the Schools of <a href="https://scas.asu.edu/">Complex Adaptive Systems</a> and <a href="https://shesc.asu.edu/">Human Evolution & Social Change</a> at Arizona State University (USA). He is Executive Director of the <a href="https://openmodelingfoundation.org">Open Modeling Foundation</a>, a global consortium of organizations to promote standards and best practices in computational modeling across the social and natural sciences. He also directs the <a href="https://comses.net">Network for Computational Modeling in Social and Ecological Sciences</a>, an international scientific network to enable accessibility, open science, and best practices for computation in the socio-ecological sciences. Barton received his BA from the University of Kansas in Anthropology/Archaeology, and MA and PhD from the University of Arizona in Anthropology/Archaeology and Geosciences. His research centers around  long-term human ecology, landscape dynamics, and the multi-dimensional interactions between social and biophysical systems, integrating computational modeling, geospatial technologies, and data science with geoarchaeological field studies. Barton has directed transdisciplinary research on hunter-gatherers and small-holder farmers in the Mediterranean and North America for over three decades, and directs research on human-environmental interactions in the modern world. He is a member of the open-source <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org">GRASS GIS</a> Development Team and Project Steering Committee, dedicated to making advanced geospatial technologies openly accessible to the world.</p>

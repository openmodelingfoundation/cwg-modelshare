<p>Open Modeling Foundation Working Groups coordinate key activities, enabling a diverse spectrum of modeling scientists to participate directly in OMF activities and self-governance, ensuring that it can fulfill its vision, mission, and goals. The Certification Working Group (CWG) develops and administers programs to certify model code that meets OMF standards for modeling best practices, and officially recognize model developers who apply these standards.</p>

<p>The CWG’s ModelShare Programme will convene experts in a series of workshops looking at current best practices and recommendations for improving the quality of the metadata in model-sharing and publishing platforms.</p>

<p>The Programme is in its early days and further details are yet to follow. You can stay informed by joining the CWG’s Google Group <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/omf-cwg-modelshare">here</a>. Members of the Google Group will receive email updates about the ModelShare Programme.</p>

<strong>Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/omf-cwg-modelshare">🔗ModelShare Google Group</a> to receive email updates about the Programme and information about ways you can get involved.</strong>

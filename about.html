<p>The ModelShare Programme stems from the work of the Open Modeling Foundation and the <a href="https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org/governance/working-groups/#certification-working-group">Certification Working Group</a>. The <a href="https://www.openmodelingfoundation.org">Open Modeling Foundation</a> is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists. The Certification Working Group (CWG) develops and administers programs to certify model code that meets OMF standards for modeling best practices, and officially recognize model developers who apply these standards.</p>

<p>You can stay informed by joining our Google Group <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/omf-cwg-modelshare">here</a>. Members of the Google Group will receive email updates about the ModelShare Programme.</p>

<p>This work was enabled in part by generous support from the <a href="https://alliancecan.ca/en">Digital Research Alliance of Canada</a> and the <a href="https://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>.</p>
